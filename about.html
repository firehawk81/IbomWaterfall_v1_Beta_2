                                        * My inspiration primarily came from a desire to give back to my homeland – the ancient and well renowned Kingdom of Arochukwu where I grew up and went to primary school. As a young child growing up in the 70s and early 80s, I vividly remember seeing tourists of all shades (including expatriates) coming to Arochukwu to visit the Ibini Ukpabi (Long Juju) Shrine, “Ulo nta ndi Okoroji”, and other famous traditional and historical sites in the town. Those visits have long slowed down to a trickle because of the prevailing (mostly infrastructural) challenges in recent times. Ibom Waterfalls Resort and Suites aims to provide world class accommodation and entertainment facilities to support the return of tourism and trade which in turn will boost the economy of Arochukwu and surrounding communities.

                    </div>
            <p>Arochukwu, located in Abia State Nigeria, is a historically significant town which is accessible from the Victor 
                Attah International Airport Uyo (approx. 1.5hr commute). The most striking feature of Arochukwu (and the one most
                 appreciated by visitors) is the calm, serene and secure feeling of being in the town. The people are welcoming, 
                 friendly and will go to great lengths to make a visitor feel at home. Arochukwu can also be accessed easily from
                  Umuahia, the Abia State capital as well as the commercial hub of Aba.

            <p>Must-see Cultural and Historical site</p>
            <p>Arochukwu is home to several notable historical sites that reflect its rich heritage and significance in Nigerian history:</p>
            <p>1.⁠ ⁠Ibini Ukpabi (Long Juju) Shrine: This sacred oracle was the spiritual and judicial center of the Aro Confederacy,
                 serving as a powerful influence in the region. Although it was believed to be destroyed during the British 
                 colonial invasion, the shrine still exists and is a major tourist attraction today.</p>
            <p>2.⁠ ⁠Okoroji House Museum: This museum showcases the history and culture of the Aro people, including artifacts and exhibits 
                related to their traditional practices and the impact of the Aro Confederacy on southeastern Nigeria.</p>
            <p>3.⁠ ⁠79 Steps Arochukwu Waterfalls: A natural site that offers scenic beauty and an opportunity for visitors to experience the 
                region's landscape. It has become a popular spot for both locals and tourists.</p>
            <p>4.⁠ ⁠Cave Temple Complex: This site is part of the historical religious landscape of Arochukwu, where rituals were 
                performed and significant events in Aro history took place. It is linked to the broader narrative of the Aro's 
                influence during the slave trade era</p>
            <p>5. Eze Aro Palace: The Palace of the traditional ruler of Arochukwu, known as Eze Aro, is an important site that 
                reflects the town’s history and cultural heritage.</p>
            <p>6. Notable Educational Institutions: 
                Located within a walking distance of Ibom Waterfall Resort and suites is the first private Secondary School in Nigeria
                 – Aggrey Memorial Secondary School which was established by the foremost educationist and first Minister of education
                  in the First Republic - Dr. Alvan Ikoku.
                </p>
            <p>Other notable educational institutions include the Abia State College of Education and the Mary Slessor school, which was
                 named after the renowned Scottish missionary Mary Slessor, who played a significant role in promoting education and 
                 social reforms in Nigeria during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Slessor is celebrated for her efforts to stop 
                 the infanticide of twins and for advocating for women’s rights among the Efik people in the Calabar region, which is 
                 geographically close to Arochukwu.
